# READ FIRST
This project has reached EOL, which means that no new features will be developed. We're only merging bug fixes and/or security pull requests. You can read more about this decision by joining our [official Discord server](https://discord.gg/powercord).

# Installation
See the [installation page of the Powercord Wiki](https://github.com/powercord-org/powercord/wiki/Installation).

# How can I install Powercord on Stable or PTB?
Injecting to Stable or PTB is unsupported. These versions may not work properly and support will not be given. However, if you wish to use these versions, you can use `npm run plug stable` or `npm run plug ptb` respectively. The `unplug` command works the same way.

# Is this against the ToS?
Long story short... __yes__. Powercord is against the Discord Terms of Service â€” but, you should keep reading:  

As of right now, __Discord is not going out of their way to detect client mods or ban client mod users__. On top of that, Powercord does not make any manual HTTP requests unlike certain client mods / plugins, so your client's user agent is the same as a legitimate client. Meaning, Discord doesn't detect a client mod like Powercord. They can go out of their way to start detecting it, but they don't.  

Hypothetically speaking - even if they somehow did detect Powercord, users are very unlikely to be banned on sight. It doesn't make sense for Discord to start banning a substantial part of it's userbase (client mod users) without any kind of warning. Not to mention it is mandatory for Powercord plugins to be fully API-compliant and ethical, implying Powercord users can't be banned for indirect ToS violations (e.g. selfbotting).
